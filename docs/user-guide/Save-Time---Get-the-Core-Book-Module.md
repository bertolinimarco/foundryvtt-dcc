If you want to save yourself time entering the content from the book as spells, items, or tables, you can buy the core book module from [Goodman Games](https://goodman-games.com).


Access all of the spells, equipment, critical hit and fumble tables, class descriptions, and rules text from the Dungeon Crawl Classics Core Rulebook from within Foundry! Installing this module automatically wires up tables to the DCC RPG System character sheets within Foundry, so when you roll a crit, you see your result in the chat.

Drag and Drop spells and items onto character sheets, and drag core book monsters right out onto the battlefield, with their tokens pre-configured.

Link to the rules for your character class right from your character sheet! Read spell descriptions and roll spell results from inside Foundry!
