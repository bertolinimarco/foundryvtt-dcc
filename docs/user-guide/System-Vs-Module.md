# System vs. Module

Once you have purchased Foundry itself, you can use the DCC *system* for no additional cost.

The system has rollable character sheets, and you can make your own adventure modules or use the pre-built adventure modules.

You can use just the system's rollable sheets to play DCC RPG, but you will not have access to the core book content, such as spells, items, and tables like crits and fumbles.

You can hand-enter that content from your copy of the DCC RPG Core Book, or you can [purchase the DCC Core Book](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/395496/dungeon-crawl-classics-core-book-compendium-for-foundry-vtt?affiliate_id=64555) *module* to save yourself many, many hours of work.

The core book module includes all the spells, items, critical hit/fumble tables, class descriptions and tables, and rules text from the Dungeon Crawl Classics Core Rulebook.

The *module* content is all copyrighted material, so it is not free.

Since there is significant work in translating this content to FoundryVTT format, it must be purchased separately even if you own the paper or PDF rulebook. DriveThruRPG regularly has sales, so keep an eye out if the price is a factor for you.

To activate modules you have purchased, follow the instructions in [Installing the Paid Foundry Modules](
