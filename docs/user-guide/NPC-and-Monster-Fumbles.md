[Goodman Games Yearbook #8](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/336438/goodman-games-yearbook-8-the-year-that-shall-not-be-named?affiliate_id=64555) has rules for Monster Fumbles.

If you have the DCC Core Book installed, it includes these rules and enables them automatically.

You can disable them via the DCC Core Book setting "Register NPC Fumble Tables".

There is not a separate setting for Fumble Table on NPCs, it uses the Crit Table. It translates Crit Tables III-IV-V to Fumble table H.

Note that since the system is unaware of the target's Luck modifier, it always rolls 1d10 for monster fumbles when Crit/Fumble automation is enabled.

Rules-as-Written, a different fumble die is rolled if the target is a PC and they have a Luck modifier other than zero. You can do this after an automatic fumble is rolled by clicking on the fumble table, adjusting the formula, and roll manually. RAW, the formula moves up or down the dice chain one die for each Luck modifier step (so PCs with +3 Luck would cause the NPC/Monster to roll 1d16 on the fumble table rather than 1d10).

You can use the Elemental Crit/Fumble table by setting the Crit Table of your elemental to 'EL'.
