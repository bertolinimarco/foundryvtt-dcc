# Saving Throws

Saving throws are auto-calculated by default.

You can disable this in the </>Config menu for a character with this checkbox:

![Saving Throws Config Checkbox](images/saving_throws_config_checkbox.png)

To edit the calculation for a Saving throw, click in the value for a save like you were going to edit it:
![Saving Throws Value Edit](images/saving_throws_value_edit.png)

This will bring up a dialog where you can edit the class bonus for a character, as well as adding an extra bonus.

You can use the Override to override the calculation entirely with a value of your choice. This enables you to keep the auto-calculation on for other saves.
