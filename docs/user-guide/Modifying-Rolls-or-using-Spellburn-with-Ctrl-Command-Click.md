You can modify rolls on the fly by CTRL (PC) or Command (MAC) clicking a roll. This will allow you to modify many aspects of the roll. You can do this with any roll on the character sheet, and some rolls have their own options to modify.

You can even use Spellburn with spells, and they will reduce physical stats.
