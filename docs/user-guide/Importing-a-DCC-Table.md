You can use the **EasyTable module** to import a table straight from a PDF. First click the **Settings** icon (3 gears) in the top right and click **Configure Settings**, then the **Module Settings** tab. Scroll down to **EasyTable** and make sure **Paste from table mode** is checked.


Next, go to the **Rollable Tables** tab in the upper right of the Foundry interface and click **New EasyTable** at the bottom of the sidebar.

Copy/paste your table from the PDF into Notepad or (Notes on the Mac). Make sure each line is a number, followed by an entry. If the entry is very long it can word wrap, but **make sure it is all part of the same line**. If it isn’t, the table won’t come out right.  You may also want to do a find and replace on “- “ to remove the hyphenations. Make sure **Enable Safemode?** is checked.

Copy/Paste from Notepad/Notes into **Table Data** in Foundry and click **Generate**.


The table is generated and you can roll on it. You may need to correct the **Roll Table Formula**.
