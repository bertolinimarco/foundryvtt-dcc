The Cleric tab has the cleric-specific skills, such as Lay on Hands, Divine Aid, and Turn Unholy.

As your cleric accrues disapproval from failed spells, the disapproval number on this tab will go up. You can adjust or reset it manually.

If your cleric's deity has their own disapproval table that you have created, you can choose that here.

There is also a handy reference chart for those skills on this tab.

Cleric spells are on the Spells tab.
