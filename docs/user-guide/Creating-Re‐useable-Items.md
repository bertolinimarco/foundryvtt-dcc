You can create a weapon (mundane or magic) that can be stored in a compendium for other uses, or dragged onto a character if they have that item. 


Click the **Items Directory** tab in the top right (looks like a suitcase) and select **Create Item**. 


Now you can create a weapon, just like we did earlier, but you can put it in a Compendium. You can drag it to any character sheet to give them the Weapon, Treasure, Equipment, etc.
