# Creating/Importing an NPC

To import an NPC from a PDF, you can use the importer. Click **Import Actor(s)** at the bottom of the actors tab.


Copy it out of the PDF just like this (**the period has to be included, it is a delimiter**): 

![Import Monster](docs/user-guide/images/import_monster.png)

Paste into the Import Actors window and hit Import Actor(s).
