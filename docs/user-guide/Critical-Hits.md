You can add critical hit tables and put them in a compendium. That way you can automatically roll a critical hit when you roll a natural 20. Just import a table with EasyTable, and title it:

Then when you reference a crit table (in the character or NPCâ€™s sheet) it will automatically be rolled on, as long as it meets that syntax, and as long as you have referenced your compendium in System Settings.

This Toad-Goyle will use Crit Table M:
