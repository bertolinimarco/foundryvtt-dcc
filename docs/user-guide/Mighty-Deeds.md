You then need to roll your Mighty Deed before each attack (by clicking Roll Deed Die), and the attack will then automatically include it as a bonus to hit and damage.

To roll your Mighty Deed fresh with every attack roll, you can change **Attack Bonus Mode** to Roll Per Attack in your sheet config.
