# Reporting Bugs

The best place to report bugs with the DCC system is the [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/foundryvtt-dcc/dcc/issues).

Ensure you have the latest version of the DCC system installed before reporting a bug, as it may have already been fixed.

Also ensure you have tried with no other 3rd party modules installed, as they may be causing the issue.
